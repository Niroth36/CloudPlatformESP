# AMQP 1.0 nodes for Node-RED

This project provides a set of nodes for [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/) that makes it easy to integrate E2C Broker which is base AMQP 1.0 protocol in a flow application.

## Installation

The nodes are based on [rhea library](https://github.com/grs/rhea), a reactive library for AMQP 1.0 protocol for easy development of both clients and servers. It's needed to install that library before starting to use rhea nodes inside a Node-RED flow. The simpler way to do it is use the Node Package Manager (NPM) and install the [rhea module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rhea).
